            <p>Since graduating from the George Brown diploma program in 1989, I have been a Child and Youth Worker. It
                became apparent to me that I was developing a passion for what I had discovered and my involvement in
                the
                profession deepened to the point where I decided to attend the University of Victoria and graduated with
                a
                BA in Child and Youth Counselling. From there, it was at Nova University that I attained my Master’s in
                Family Support Work. I am currently enrolled in a PhD program in Counseling Studies at Capella
                University. I
                have worked 5 years at Sheridan College and currently teaching at Georgian College in the Child and
                Youth
                Care program.</p>
            <p>It has been a privilege to work at Peel Children Center, York Children’s Aid, and these last twenty years
                at
                Thistletown Regional Center as well as in private practice. I have enjoyed individual, group and family
                work, all alongside multidisciplinary teams. I have participated in assessment, intervention, research,
                outdoor camp programs, teaching and in workshops. I have been a member of the board of the Child and
                Youth
                Care Association working to promote the profession. I am currently employed at Sheridan College. My
                education and experience have prepared me to share teaching opportunities at Sheridan. Sheridan’s
                innovation, collaborative model and dedicated team members make me proud to be part of the Sheridan
                community...</p>

                <p>Some of my proudest moments have been working with clients who struggle and over time develop a
                    relationship
                    and using therapeutic modalities you see change, hope and joy in their life. I am also proud of
                    presenting
                    at the Child and Youth Care Conference locally and internationally. Having a passion for learning
                    has
                    led me
                    to enroll in a Phd program and it is an accomplishment to continue learning in order to benefit
                    clients
                    and
                    students.</p>
                <p>The unity of the Child and Youth Care field is an opportunity to have a strong supportive body of
                    professionals advocating for clients, families and the profession. The association is becoming a
                    stronger
                    body and advocates for the profession. Our body of knowledge, research, ethics and code of conduct
                    all
                    promote our uniqueness and profession. The profession is becoming stronger with having more Child
                    and
                    Youth
                    Workers in schools, hospital, mental health agencies, justice, community development, and policy and
                    legislation. It is each of our responsibility to keep learning and advocate for clients, communities
                    and
                    high standards of academics.</p>
                <p>Some interesting adjuncts to my repertoire are areas of special interest: working with families and
                    groups,
                    using creative media, mindfulness therapy, trauma, resilience, attachment theory, system theory,
                    visualization and meditation. Things I cannot live without are my family and friends, hiking and
                    camping
                    with my husband and three sons, making pottery in my studio over-looking the pond, or just sitting
                    on
                    the
                    deck in the company of a good book. But, my favorite past time is laughing and experiencing joy with
                    others.</p>
