        <p>Since graduating from the George Brown diploma program in 1989, I have been a Child and Youth Worker. It
            became apparent to me that I was developing a passion for what I had discovered and my involvement in the
            profession deepened to the point where I decided to attend the University of Victoria and graduated with a
            BA in Child and Youth Counselling. From there, it was at Nova University that I attained my Master’s in
            Family Support Work. I am currently enrolled in a PhD program in Counseling Studies at Capella University. I
            have worked 5 years at Sheridan College and currently teaching at Georgian College in the Child and Youth
            Care program.</p>
        <p>It has been a privilege to work at Peel Children Center, York Children’s Aid, and these last twenty years at
            Thistletown Regional Center as well as in private practice. I have enjoyed individual, group and family
            work, all alongside multidisciplinary teams. I have participated in assessment, intervention, research,
            outdoor camp programs, teaching and in workshops. I have been a member of the board of the Child and Youth
            Care Association working to promote the profession. I am currently employed at Sheridan College. My
            education and experience have prepared me to share teaching opportunities at Sheridan. Sheridan’s
            innovation, collaborative model and dedicated team members make me proud to be part of the Sheridan
            community.</p>
        <p>Some of my proudest moments have been working with clients who struggle and over time develop a relationship
            and using therapeutic modalities you see change, hope and joy in their life. I am also proud of presenting
            at the Child and Youth Care Conference locally and internationally. Having a passion for learning has led me
            to enroll in a Phd program and it is an accomplishment to continue learning in order to benefit clients and
            students.</p>
        <p>The unity of the Child and Youth Care field is an opportunity to have a strong supportive body of
            professionals advocating for clients, families and the profession. The association is becoming a stronger
            body and advocates for the profession. Our body of knowledge, research, ethics and code of conduct all
            promote our uniqueness and profession. The profession is becoming stronger with having more Child and Youth
            Workers in schools, hospital, mental health agencies, justice, community development, and policy and
            legislation. It is each of our responsibility to keep learning and advocate for clients, communities and
            high standards of academics.</p>
        <p>Some interesting adjuncts to my repertoire are areas of special interest: working with families and groups,
            using creative media, mindfulness therapy, trauma, resilience, attachment theory, system theory,
            visualization and meditation. Things I cannot live without are my family and friends, hiking and camping
            with my husband and three sons, making pottery in my studio over-looking the pond, or just sitting on the
            deck in the company of a good book. But, my favorite past time is laughing and experiencing joy with
            others.</p>
