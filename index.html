            <h1>WELCOME</h1>
            <p>and congratulations on taking the first step to wholeness by investing in yourself and the relationships that are important to you.</p>

            <p>It is not easy to take that first step, but here you are, ready for change. You are about to get the help you want to make the best choices for your life by learning about yourself, and learning new ways to think and act. Psychotherapy can not only help everyone see their own life more clearly and positively. Psychotherapy provides the tools that increase self-knowledge, and develops skills to handle the everyday challenges that face you and everyone.</p>


            <p>Life can sometimes be confusing and difficult. It can seem like a struggle just getting to know ourselves, never mind answering lifeâ€™s tough questions and having the strength to act on them. Timely psychotherapy is not just for when we reach a crisis point, or to heal our old wounds. Working on ourselves can help us grow and build a positive future for ourselves and our loved ones.</p>

            <p>I have been privileged to work alongside hundreds of people who have wanted support and knowledge through times of change or stress at home, at school or at work, or with their health or community. Most people need someone to help them through difficult or uncertain times. Other people simply reach a point of stagnation and feel that their lives lack enrichment and a new way forward. Through guided self-discovery and mindfulness reflective practice, I would like to be there to help you take a more active part in building you a vibrant presence in and maximum enjoyment of your life.</p>

            <p>By listening to what is most important to you, and then developing insights about your experiences, we can identify the causes and effects that hold you back, as well as discover the hidden passions, strengths and resources you will use to alter your course toward more joyful living. I dedicate not only a lifetime of skill to your wholeness and growth, but above all, my sincere belief in your potential. You have my promise of compassion, open-mindedness and a creative attitude in every moment we share.</p>

            <p>I very much look forward to working with you,
                <br> Mary Ventrella</p>
