        <h3>WELCOME</h3>
        <p>It is not easy to take that first step, but here you are, ready for change.
            You are about to get the help you want to make the best choices for your life
            by learning about yourself, and learning new ways to think and act. Psychotherapy
            can not only help everyone see their own life more clearly and positively.
            Psychotherapy provides the tools that increase self-knowledge, and develops skills to handle the
            everyday
            challenges that face you and everyone.</p>

        <p>I have been privileged to work alongside hundreds of people who have wanted support and knowledge through
            times of change or stress at home, at school or at work, or with their health or community.
            Through guided self-discovery and mindfulness reflective practice, I would like to be there to help you
            take
            a more active part in building you a vibrant presence in and maximum enjoyment of your life.</p>

        <p>By listening to what is most important to you, and then developing insights about your experiences, we
            can
            identify the causes and effects that hold you back, as well as discover the hidden passions, strengths
            and
            resources you will use to alter your course toward more joyful living. You have my promise
            of compassion, open-mindedness and a creative attitude in every moment we share.</p>

        <p>I very much look forward to working with you,
            <br> Mary Ventrella</p>
